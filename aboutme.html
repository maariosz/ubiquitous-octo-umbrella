In our 35 years of designing and dressmaking, we have a 100% satisfaction rate. We have never left a client dissatisfied with our work. 
We credit, side-by-side with our fit, our passion for the art of hand work. 
We always have and always will give each gown's finishing touch by hand.

<p class="whitebackground">

    The traditional signature cutting style and zero use of patterns, allow our gowns to compliment all shapes and sizes (even women expecting). 
    We are truly proud of our ability to make all women feel confident and beautiful. Our purpose is to not only create your dream gown, but to also eliminate the stressful dress shopping process. 
    So not only do we guarantee a simplified, stress-free process, but you also have a money back guarantee if you are not fully satisfied with what we create.
