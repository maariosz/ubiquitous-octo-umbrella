Throughout the years we have fashioned (through a passed down, self-taught method) a large variety of dresses, each tailored specifically towards our clientsâ€™ body shapes. 
So, in turn, completely transforming the figure; accentuating what you love about your body and making you love what you do not. 
No matter your size or shape, tell us your dream gown and we will make it a reality.

At Leonora Couture, each gown is custom-made to perfection. So, we take great pride in even the smallest of details. 
We never have and never will use patterns, so we can guarantee and exemplary fit-specifically suited to your wants and needs.
